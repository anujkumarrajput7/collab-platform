## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### Authentication
```
POST /api/auth/signup  - Register new user
POST /api/auth/login   - Login user
```

### Messages
```
POST /api/messages              - Send message
GET  /api/messages/thread/:userId - Get conversation
```

### Campaigns
```
GET  /api/campaigns     - List all campaigns
POST /api/campaigns     - Create campaign (company only)
GET  /api/campaigns/:id - Get single campaign
```

### Users
```
GET /api/influencers    - Get all users (for contacts)
GET /api/influencers/me - Get current user profile
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If login/signup doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running on port 5001
3. Check CORS is enabled (should see no CORS errors)

### If messages don't send:
1. Ensure you're logged in
2. Check JWT token exists in localStorage
3. Verify both users exist in database

### If can't see campaigns:
1. Create campaigns using API/Postman first
2. Ensure MongoDB connection is active
3. Check network tab for API responses

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Create a startup** (required before creating campaigns)
2. **Create campaigns** as a Company user
3. **Apply to campaigns** as an Influencer
4. **Set up payments** (currently simulated)
5. **Add social profiles** as Influencer
